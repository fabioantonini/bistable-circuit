The pscirc package is distributed as a standard TeX Directory Structure (TDS)
folder, see http://tug.org/tds/tds.html

Source and style files are located in

texmf-local-pscirc/tex/latex/local/Pscirc

while documentation files are located in

texmf-local-pscirc/doc/local/Pscirc

Installation depends on the operating system and the TeX system in use.
For most distributions:

- copy the folder texmf-local-pscirc to some location on your filesystem
  (NOT as a subfolder of the TeX installation tree)

- refresh the database so that the package files (pscirc3.sty and
  pscclibim.sty) are found upon compilation.
  E.g., for MiKTeX distributions see https://miktex.org/kb/texmf-roots
